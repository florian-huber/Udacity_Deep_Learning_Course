# Udacity_Deep_Learning_Course
Exercises for Udacity's free deep learning course

Similar to https://github.com/rndbrtrnd/udacity-deep-learning this here is mostly share my solutions of the assignments I have done during thee [Udacity MOOC on Deep Learning with Google](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730). 
It's a very nice, free online course. Clearly worth checking out.

### Disclaimer: 
There is probably a code of conduct if you are enrolled in the nanodegree. Copying the code from the repository and pretending it to be sure would be bad. Even looking into it may be an infringement. Talk to your instructor.

Apart from that, I hope this might help some that are not enrolled in the nanodegree program. And any hints and tipps how to solve things more effectively, elegantly, better, faster (you get it) ... is highly welcome.

Cheers.
